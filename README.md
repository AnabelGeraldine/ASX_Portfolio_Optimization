The results showed that an optimal portfolio without short selling allocated $10,000 to BHP, yielding a mean return of $9.9 with an associated risk of $173.21​. Additionally, an alternative portfolio with short selling included leveraged positions, where $10,000 was borrowed at the risk-free rate to optimize asset allocation​. These results illustrate the trade-off between risk and return in financial portfolio construction and provide insights into efficient investment strategies.
